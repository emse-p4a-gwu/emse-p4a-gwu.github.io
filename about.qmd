This course was inspired by many other courses / resources that cover similar material. In addition to my own developed material, I have also modified material from other courses and workshops - a full list of sources can be found in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.html) page.

This course was first created by Dr. John Paul Helveston at the George Washington University for the Fall 2019 semester of Intro to Programming for Analytics.
